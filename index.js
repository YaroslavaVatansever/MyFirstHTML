At this point you should probably start to learn JavaScript. You're doing well enough with HTML and CSS

// The comment above is a multiline comment. You can also use single line comments like this. Use cmd + / as a shortcut to comment a line out with a single line comment. The hotkey for this works on the line where your cursor is placed no matter where in the line the cursor is sitting. Practice using the hotkey on this line in various places to see the functionality. Also, multiline comments are appropriate when you want to write a comment as long as this one. I made this comment super long intentionally so you can see how frustrating it is to read a super long single line comment.

shift + opt + a allows you to make a multiline comment
