    <h2>The Content Division element</h2>
     <p class="text">
        The div HTML element is the generic container for flow content. 
        It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some 
        way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some 
        kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

    <h3>Multiple div elements</h3>
    <p>You can have many div containers on the same page.</p>

             <h2>Lviv</h2>
             <p>
                Lviv is a city in western Ukraine, around 70 kilometers
                from the border with Poland. Traces of its Polish and Austro-Hungarian 
                heritage are evident in its architecture, which blends Central and 
                Eastern European styles with those of Italy and Germany. 
                In High Castle Park, the mountaintop ruins of a 14th-century castle provide 
                panoramic views of the city's green-domed churches and the surrounding hills.

             <p>
                Odesa is a port city on the Black Sea in southern Ukraine. 
                It's known for its beaches and 19th-century architecture, 
                including the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater. 
                The monumental Potemkin Stairs, immortalized in "The Battleship Potemkin," 
                lead down to the waterfront with its Vorontsov Lighthouse. Running parallel 
                to the water, the grand Primorsky Boulevard is a popular promenade lined 
                with mansions and monuments.
