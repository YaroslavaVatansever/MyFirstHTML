    <h1>Traditional Ukrainian Potato Varenyky</h1>
    
    <section class="what-is-varenyky">
      <p>
        These Ukrainian half-moon-shaped stuffed dumplings can be sweet or savory, served boiled or fried, garnished with fried onions and served with sour cream, or served plain. These characteristics vary regionally and based on individual family traditions. The recipe below is how my family makes varenyky: boiled, tossed with browned onions, lots of sour cream on the side.

          <h2>What's the difference between pierogi and varenyky?</h2>
          <p> 
            There is virtually no difference between Polish pierogi and Ukrainian varenyky. Both are half-moon-shaped stuffed dumplings. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One minor difference is the commitment to sour cream. Ukrainians love, love, love sour cream and put it on absolutely everything. We would never eat varenyky (sweet or savory) without sour cream and if for some reason we didn't have any and there was a zombie apocalypse and we couldn't make it to the store, we wouldn't even bother making them. Some Polish cooks do serve sour cream alongside their pierogi but it's my understanding that it's optional.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having eaten thousands of pierogi in the company of fellow Ukrainians and a decent amount with my partner's Polish family, another difference I've noticed is that pierogi tend to be slightly larger in size than varenyky.

        <h2>HOW TO STORE VARENYKY?</h2>
        <p>
          Varenyky are best served hot straight from the boiling water. It is not recommended to eat them cold, but you can also fry leftover varenyky to get crispy ones.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>CAN WE FREEZE VARENYKY?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, you can easily freeze varenyky before cooking them in boiling water. Keep the varenyky in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 months. When ready to serve, cook them in boiling water until they float, plus 2 minutes.
