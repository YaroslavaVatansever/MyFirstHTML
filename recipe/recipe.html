          These Ukrainian halfmoon-shaped stuffed dumplings can be sweet or savory,
          served boiled or fried, garnished with fried onions and served with sour
          cream, or served plain. These characteristics vary regionally and based on
          individual family traditions. The recipe below is how my family does
          varenyky: boiled, tossed with browned onions, lots of sour cream on the
          side.

            <h3>What's the difference between pierogi and varenyky?</h3>
            <p> 
              There is virtually no difference between Polish pierogi and Ukrainian 
              varenyky. Both are halfmoon-shaped stuffed dumplings. 
              One minor difference is the commitment to sour cream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians love, love, love sour cream and put it on absolutely everything.
              We would never eat varenyky (sweet or savory) without sour cream and if for 
              some reason we didn't have any and there was a zombie apocalypse and we couldn't 
              make it to the store, we wouldn't even bother making them. Some Polish cooks do serve 
              sour cream alongside their pierogi but it's my understanding that it's optional.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having eaten thousands of pierogi in the company of fellow Ukrainians and a decent amount 
              with my partner's Polish family, another difference I've noticed is that pierogi tend to be 
              slightly larger in size than varenyky.

          leftover varenyky and get crispy varenyky.
